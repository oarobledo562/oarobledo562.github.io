                <p>The creature I have created is called the Pink Gallasnatch. The Pink Gallasnatch is easily distinguishable because of its bright reddish-pink body. Pink Gallasnatches displays both mammalian and reptilian qualities as seen by their scaly tails, crocodilian faces, hooved feet, and long patches of fur. Another unique quality of the Pink Gallasnatch is the arboreal protrusions found at the base of the skull.
                   Pink Gallasnatches mainly derive sustinence from an omnivorous diet but can also obtain energy by performing photosynthesis through the leaves found on their branchy antlers. During a certain time of year, Pink Gallasnatches can go days without eating as long as they receive enough sunlight to fuel their bodies. Due to the illusive nature of the Pink Gallasnatch, not much else is known about their existence. Some even believe them to be mythical guardians of nature because they are rarely seen and look otherworldly in appearance. </p>
